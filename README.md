As a qualified Pluralsight Unity Expert since 2017 and working with Unity every day, I know my way around the engine and developing interactive content for all platforms. Rigs, animations, addressables, shaders, particles, asset optimization, project organization, and even some multiplayer networking... I've covered some bases and continue on the path in this fast changing field.

I've been passionate about video games and multimedia my whole life. For more than 15 years I've been learning and creating 3D work. With a Bachelors of Science focused in 3D Animation and Video Game Development my work is my hobby.

Today I continue to expand my skills and expertise. I love all things multimedia from games, movies, music, photography and art.

I've worked directly with well known clients in the entertainment industry including Disney, Star Wars, Marvel, Dreamworks, Ubisoft, Warner Bros, 343 Industries, and more.
